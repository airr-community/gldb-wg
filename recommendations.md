Mission
-------

To promote the comprehensive and accurate identification, description, classification, annotation, curation, and consistent use of germline IG and TR genes/alleles across species, strains, and populations.

Background
----------

Comprehensive germline immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) gene/allele reference collections are critical for the accurate sequence analysis of adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) datasets. For more than two decades, the International ImMunoGeneTics Information System (IMGT) has led efforts to compile, annotate, and curate germline sequences for IG and TR variable, diversity, joining, and constant gene loci, including the establishment of an IG/TR nomenclature system. The development of high-throughput sequencing, and the large datasets that can now be produced from single individuals, have created a new capacity to define human genetic variation within IG and TR loci through the inference of novel polymorphisms for AIRR datasets. Evidence from the study of immune gene loci in the current era indicate our understanding of population level immune gene variation is incomplete. The IG/TR germline reference sets, commonly referred to within the field as germline databases (GLDBs), are therefore also incomplete. This is true for the human as well as for model organisms, but the present proposal mainly considers human genes and allelic variants.

Establishment of the Germline Databases Working Group
-----------------------------------------------------

At the AIRR Community meeting in June 2016, the Tools and Resources Working Group was given a mandate by the AIRR Community to “initiate the construction of an open germline database,” including the determination of “suggested criteria for inclusion of novel allele inferred from rearranged sequence.” This project was ultimately delegated to an an ad-hoc subcommittee, which has come to be known as the Germline Databases Working Group (GLDB WG). As for all AIRR Community working groups, membership of the GLDB WG has been open to all interested parties, with recruitment coming by word of mouth, and by advertising the existence of the group through the B-T.CR community discussion site. Over the last fifteen months, 37 people have joined the group, and regular discussions have typically involved 12–15 participants spanning the globe. 

Goals of the Germline Databases Working Group
---------------------------------------------

The overall purpose of the GLDB WG is to promote the complete and accurate description of germline IG and TR genes, and their allelic variants, within populations of different species. The focus of the GLDB WG in 2017 has been on IG/TR GLDBs of humans and species of biomedical importance. It has considered issues concerning nomenclature, copyright/licensing and technical capabilities/infrastructure of GLDBs, but most attention has focused upon the shared desire to submit inferred gene/alleles to GLDBs and the administrative and technical processes associated with this. 

In 2018, the GLDB WG proposes to focus on the development of criteria for the inference of other human IGH genes, light chain genes and TR genes, as well as genes from other species. It will begin the evaluation and further development of GLDBs of species of medical importance, and will continue to work to enhance GLDBs through improved and standardized formats and annotation.

Relationships between the GLDB WG and Other Stakeholders
--------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this document is to describe the aims of the GLDB WG, and to document how the GLDB WG hopes to work with other bodies. However, as the relationships between AIRR and IUIS are still developing, the purpose of this document and of the GLDB WG recommendations is not to describe any formal structures within which the GLDB WG wishes to operate in the future, as they will have to evolve over time. 

The GLDB WG has had valuable discussions with the IMGT leadership, with a view to working together to address the incompleteness of germline reference resources. Specifically:

* Jamie Scott and Felix Breden met with IMGT in Montpellier in November 2016.

* Corey Watson and Christian Busse met with IMGT in Montpellier in February 2017.

* Eleven members of the GLDB WG were able to meet with Marie-Paule Lefranc at the “Stochasticity and Control in the Dynamics and Diversity of Immune Repertoires” conference in Jerusalem, Israel held from 18-23 June 2017.

* The general position of the GLDB WG was most recently provided to IMGT in late October 2017.

The challenges associated with the inference of germline genes
--------------------------------------------------------------

The GLDB WG and IMGT agree that previously unrecognized alleles can be inferred from deep sequencing data of rearranged IG and TR genes. The challenge is to define procedures for submission and curation as well as criteria that reduce the chance of the false identification of new ‘alleles’, e.g. as a result of sequence variation arising from somatic point mutations. To safeguard against this the GLDB WG proposes the following three actions:

1. The final acceptance of any inference should require manual review and curation. This task should be assigned to a new Inferred Allele Working Group (IAWG, see below). This group is intended to work with or within the IUIS Immunoglobulins (IG), T cell Receptors (TR) and Major Histocompatibility (MH) Nomenclature Sub-Committee (IUIS IG/TR/MH NC-SC).

2. Criteria for acceptance of inferences should be clearly documented and consistently applied. In addition, inferred alleles should be documented with annotations that provide a measure of the strength of evidence in favour of the inferences.

3. A conservative approach should be adopted. For example, it may not be possible using existing inferential techniques to accept the veracity of inferences of allelic variants that are found within a dataset at relatively low frequency.

With respect to point 1, the GLDB WG advises that at the Jerusalem meeting in June 2017, Marie-Paule Lefranc in her capacity as the chair of the IUIS IG/TR/MH NC-SC proposed that “[...] the human inferred immunoglobulin allele subgroup within AIRR [...]” should be represented in and collaborate with the IUIS IG/TR/MH NC-SC and the IMGT-Nomenclature Committee (IMGT-NC).
In this document, we contrast ‘inferred alleles’ to ‘fully confirmed and named alleles’ that are in the current IMGT reference set, or that enter the IMGT system in future as a consequence of direct gene sequencing. We recognise that in some of the discussion that follows, there can be debate about the suitability of the terms ‘allele’ and ‘gene’, but believe that the intended meaning is made clear by the context in which the terms appear.

Recommendations to the AIRR Community
-------------------------------------

1) **The Germline Databases Working Group (GLDB WG) should be confirmed by the AIRR Community as a properly constituted working group within the AIRR Community and its mandate renewed to last until the next Community meeting.**

2) **Four representatives of the GLDB WG should be selected to act as the Inferred Allele Review Committee (IARC), working with or within the IUIS Immunoglobulins (IG), T cell Receptors (TR) and Major Histocompatibility (MH) Nomenclature Sub-Committee (IUIS NC-SC) and the IMGT-Nomenclature Committee (IMGT-NC). The role of the IARC will be to evaluate evidence in support of the existence of inferred alleles, guided by the recommendations of the GLDB WG.**

The AIRR Community will develop and manage an inclusive process to address the tenure of the selected individuals, and processes for the selection of future representatives. 

3) **Inferred sequences that are accepted by the IARC should be annotated by the IARC to indicate the extent of evidence in support of the inferences, using a curation framework that incorporates weight of evidence.**

Annotation of IG/TR variants will be undertaken in a manner to ensure that users are aware of the extent of evidence for an inferred allele. This should involve a three-tiered system (termed ‘traffic light’ hereafter). Sequences that only fulfill the minimal acceptance criteria (a single report) will be designated at the ‘red’ level. Red is intended to convey a ‘stop and consider’ message to the user. A second independent report of the inferred gene or allele sequence will lead to its elevation to the ‘orange’ (or ‘amber’) level, implying some ‘caution’ in the use of this allele. A third independent report of the inferred sequence will lead to its elevation to the ‘green’ level, implying considerable confidence in the inference. Evaluation and documentation of additional independent reports of a sequence will not be a responsibility of the IARC. The GLDB WG recognizes the value of evidence beyond the three initial reports, and a future goal of the GLDB WG is the development of systems to make such evidence freely available to all researchers.

A full history of annotation of inferred alleles will be maintained, and in the event that investigations establish to the satisfaction of the IARC that an inference has been made in error, the sequence will be demoted. Demotion of a red sequence will move it to the ‘black’ level, indicating that IARC believes it is erroneous.

The IARC will work with IMGT to ensure that if an inferred allele is later confirmed by direct genomic sequencing, the history of the sequence will become a part of the annotation associated with the new fully documented and named allele. The new allele name and the previously-assigned inferred allele name should be firmly linked within all relevant germline databases.

4) **The GLDB WG will review and refine assessment criteria to guide the work of IARC, using the criteria outlined in this document as a starting point. The IARC will be guided by these criteria, but confirmation of the veracity of a submitted sequence will be at the discretion of the IARC. The AIRR Community will provide an inclusive framework (through, e.g., open-invitation conferences) for future consideration and review of assessment criteria.**

Proposed criteria are shown below. 

5) **To improve the reporting of non-human IG/TR genes and allelic variants, the AIRR Community should authorize GLDB WG to establish dialogue with all appropriate stakeholders.**

6) **The GLDB WG should begin to define procedures for the recognition of genes and allelic variants by inference, in non-human species, based upon the principles established for human sequences. The suitability of those principles should be periodically evaluated in suitable model species such as the macaque.**

7) **The AIRR Community recognizes the burden that the establishment of new capabilities within the IMGT system could involve, including potential financial implications for IMGT. The AIRR Community will therefore work with IMGT to apply for funds from granting bodies in both Europe and the USA/Canada.**

The IARC, once formed, should be able to receive and assess submissions during the period before funds become available. Whether or not any work could commence on developments to IMGT systems, prior to the availability of dedicated funds, would be at the discretion of IMGT.

8) **The GLDB WG will - in collaboration with other interested parties including other AIRR WGs - continue its efforts to develop solutions that would enhance GLDBs, providing for example, standardized data formats, attribution and derivation, interfaces/APIs and version control. Furthermore the GLDB WG should assess potential issues in database licensing that could arise from implementing such capabilities and develop solutions in dialog with the respective stakeholders.**

9) **The GLDB WG will report to the AIRR Community and the wider research community on progress towards implementation of the aforementioned recommendations 1-8 at six month intervals. This reporting will include any new and/or updated recommendations of the GLDB WG, as well as decisions of the IAWG.**
