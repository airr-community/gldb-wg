# Inference Tool Output For Inferred Gene Submissions #

The Inferred Allele Review Committee expects to review a large number of submissions. To help with this work, we would like to understand
the information provided by inference tools as part of each inferred novel allele. 

IARC recognises that tools will vary in the approach and algorithms employed: therefore we indicate here the nature of the information that 
is of value to the Committee, and ask tool providers to say whether or not each item is provided by their tool, and to provide any notes
on the way or form in which it is provided. We also ask tool providers to list any additional information provided by their tool which is 
likely to be helpful.

Please provide information on your tool by completing the tables below. These cover:

- Overview information on the tool
- Information provided by the tool for each inferred allele
- Information provided by the tool on the entire genotype from which inferences were made
- Information on the identity, version and configuration of the tool used to construct the inferences.

## Overview Information ##

| Item | Description | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
{%- for field in Inference_Tool_Overview.properties %}
| `{{ field }}` | {{ Inference_Tool_Overview.properties[field].description }} |                                           |
{%- endfor %}

## Information on Each Inferred Allele ##

| Name | Description | Provided by tool? | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
{%- for field in Inferred_Sequence.properties %}
| `{{ field }}` |  {{  Inferred_Sequence.properties[field].description }} |          |                                     |
{%- endfor %}
|    | Can the above information be provided by the tool in .csv or similar format? |   |    |
 
## Information on Entire Genotyope Used for Inference ##

| Name | Description | Provided by tool? | Comments |

| `{{ field }}` | {{ Genotype.properties[field].description }} |          |                                     |
{%- endfor %}
|    | Can the above information be provided by the tool in .csv or similar format? |   |    |

## Tool And Settings ##
