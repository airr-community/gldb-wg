# Inference Tool Output For Inferred Gene Submissions #

The Inferred Allele Review Committee expects to review a large number of submissions. To help with this work, we would like to understand
the information provided by inference tools as part of each inferred novel allele, and to encourage tool providers to provide this information
in a format that is easy for submitters to quote in their submissions. Ideally, this would take the form of an 'IARC Submission Report'
generated by the tool, which would cover the items listed here, in addition to other items that would be valuable to providers.

IARC recognises that tools will vary in the approach and algorithms employed: therefore we indicate here the nature of the information that 
is of value to the Committee, and ask tool providers to say whether or not each item is provided by their tool, and to provide any notes
on the way or form in which it is provided. We also ask tool providers to list any additional information provided by their tool which is 
likely to be helpful.

Please provide information on your tool by completing the tables below. These cover:

- Overview information on the tool
- Information provided by the tool for each inferred allele
- Information provided by the tool on the entire genotype from which inferences were made
- Information on the identity, version and configuration of the tool used to construct the inferences.

## Overview Information ##

| Item | Description | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
{%- for field in Inference_Tool_Overview.properties %}
| `{{ field }}` | {{ Inference_Tool_Overview.properties[field].description }} |                                           |
{%- endfor %}

## Information on Each Inferred Allele ##

| Name | Description | Provided by tool? | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
{%- for field in Inferred_Sequence.properties %}
| `{{ field }}` |  {{  Inferred_Sequence.properties[field].description }} |          |                                     |
{%- endfor %}
|    | Can the above information be provided by the tool in .csv or similar format? |   |    |
 
## Information on Entire Genotyope Used for Inference ##

Information on the entire genotype, along the same lines as that provided for the
submitted alleles, allows the submitted alleles to be viewed in context.

| Name | Description | Provided by tool? | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
{%- for field in Genotype.properties %}
| `{{ field }}` | {{ Genotype.properties[field].description }} |          |                                     |
{%- endfor %}
|    | Can the above information be provided by the tool in .csv or similar format? |   |    |

## Tool And Settings ##

Details of the tool used and its configuration settings are important to the understanding of the report and also as a matter
of record. Generating this information from the tool itself ensures that it is accurate and comprehensive.

| Name | Description | Provided by tool? | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
{%- for field in SoftwareProcessing.properties %}
| `{{ field }}` | {{ SoftwareProcessing.properties[field].type }} | {{  SoftwareProcessing.properties[field].description }} |
{%- endfor %}
|    | Can the above information be generated automatically by the tool in .csv or similar format? |   |    |
